# Analyzing-Customer-Churn-and-Retention-Patterns-in-a-UK-Based-Multinational-Retail-Bank

# Project Background
Veritas Bank is a UK-headquartered retail bank operating across the UK, Germany, and France, serving over 3 million customers. Known for its strong digital banking capabilities and regional adaptability, the bank offers core retail services such as savings accounts, personal loans, and debit/credit card products.

In recent years, the bank has experienced rising customer churn, driven by growing competition from fintech challengers, declining engagement especially in Germany and France and the absence of targeted retention or early-warning systems. Without real-time segmentation or churn monitoring, the bank has struggled to address customer attrition proactively.

This project was initiated to help Veritas Bank understand why customers leave, identify who is most at risk, and support data-driven retention strategies. By uncovering churn drivers, comparing customer behavior across regions, and segmenting customers into risk tiers, the bank can make informed decisions to improve retention, enhance customer lifetime value, and refine acquisition strategies.

The analysis focuses on identifying churn patterns, understanding regional differences, grouping customers into actionable risk segments, and visualizing insights through interactive dashboards that enable leadership to quickly assess and respond to churn-related trends.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

1.	Customer Demographics & Segmentation	
2.	Customer Activity & Engagement
3.	Churn Patterns Across  Countries (Branches)
4.	Risk Profiling & Churn Drivers
5.	Customer Acquisition & Loyalty

# Executive Summary

The churn analysis highlights clear differences between active and inactive customers, with engagement level and credit score emerging as key churn indicators. Active customers despite having low to moderate product engagement and poor–fair credit scores generally remain with the bank, showing that activity alone is a strong retention driver.

 In contrast, inactive (or dormant) customers with similarly low engagement show mixed churn outcomes, indicating higher vulnerability. Older customers demonstrate the strongest loyalty, while younger segments show a more balanced mix of churn and retention.
 
Overall, improving engagement among inactive customers, strengthening onboarding for younger cohorts, and offering tailored credit-support programs will drive better retention outcomes.
